    1. Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR): is the ratio of number of packets received at the destinations to the number
       of packets sent from the sources
    2. Average end-to-end (E2E) delay: is the time a packet takes to route from a source to its destination through
       the network. It is the time the data packet reaches the destination minus the time the data packet was generated
       in the source node
    3. Routing Load: is calculated as the ratio between the numbers of control Packets transmitted
       to the number of packets actually received. NRL can reflect the average number of control packets required to
       successfully transmit a data packet and reflect the efficiency of the routing protocol
    4. Throughput: it can be defined as a measure of how fast the data is sent from its source to its intended
       destination without loss. In our simulation, each time the destination receives a data packet, the throughput is
       calculated and finally averaged
    5. Hop count: used to record the number of router output ports through which the packet should pass.
